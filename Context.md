As a software specialist expert in building animation library, we're building an animation Library using GSAP that will allow us to animate multiple element using data-attributes.

The project name is "Moon-Moon Animation Library".

I need you to super optimize the code
I need a lightweight library that will be easy to use and understand

The plugin will be using Javascript, GSAP, and Lenis Scoll
